  "summary": "Core Valentine flow appears implemented in frontend/src/App.tsx with a Yes-click reveal state and evasive No interactions, plus a romantic theme via Tailwind/CSS. However, the required static meme asset file is not shown as added, the initial prompt/buttons view is truncated so REQ-1 cannot be fully verified, and several non-goal features (Internet Identity/auth plumbing, backend actor scaffolding, extra footer/link) were added.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Create a single, simple romantic-themed page addressed to “Aqsa Kousar” that asks: “Will you be my Valentine?” and presents exactly two options: “Yes” and “No”.",
      "reason": "The initial (pre-Yes) UI that should contain the exact prompt and exactly two buttons is truncated in the diff, so the presence of the exact text and the constraint of exactly two primary action buttons cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",

      "reason": "The code references the static path /assets/generated/valentine-good-choice-meme.dim_1200x900.png, but the diff does not show the image file being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly lists Internet Identity authentication as a non-goal, but the diff adds an InternetIdentityProvider, useInternetIdentity hook, and useActor logic that depends on identity.",
